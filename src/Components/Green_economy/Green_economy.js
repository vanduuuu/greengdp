              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span>Sustainable Consumption and Production</span>: This focuses on improving how we produce and consume to use fewer resources, generate less waste, and emit fewer pollutants throughout the life cycle of products and processes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Resource Efficiency</span>: This means using resources in a way that delivers the most value while minimizing the amount needed and reducing emissions and waste per unit of product or service.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Overall, the Green Economy is a long-term strategy for economic growth that prioritizes investments, job creation, and skills development with a focus on sustainability.
